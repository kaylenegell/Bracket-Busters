NCAA Men's Basketball Outcome &amp; Score Predictions

This project aims to predict the outcome of NCAA Men's Basketball using two regression techniques:
- Game outcome predicted using logistic regression (one model to utilize team ranking metrics and one model without)
- Game score predicted using linear regression

Data was scraped from [Bart Torvik's 2024 T-Rank Statistics](https://www.barttorvik.com/trank.php?year=2024&sort=&conlimit=#). Maintained chronological order for training and testing to mimic real-time prediction accuracy.
